        <p>Cut it!
            (Freedom, la la la la) <br>
            (Freedom, follow me) <br>
            (Freedom, la la la la) <br>
            (Freedom)</p> 

        <p> Let me tell you, I'm vicious <br>
            Not pass-aggressive <br> 
            I got my finger on my pulse <br>
            Staring straight into a hole and I'mma get it <br>
            And I'm a savage <br>
            It's automatic <br>
            I got a way of making noise <br>
            The power to destroy with no static</p>

        <p>Now victory is all you need <br>
            So cultivate and plant the seed <br>
            Hold your breath and count to ten <br>
            Just count to ten</p>

        <p>I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell <br>
            I know it all too well <br>
            Switchblade on the edge of your wrist <br>
            Can I get a witness? (Witness) <br>
            'Cause agony brings no reward <br>
            For one more hit and one last score <br>
            Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!</p>

        <p>cut the cord! <br>
            (Freedom, la la la la) <br>
            (Freedom)</p> 

        <p>You gotta feel the courage <br>
            Embrace possession <br>
            If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered <br>
            But it's not, because it's your obsession <br>
            Be a fighter, backbone, desire <br> 
            Complicated and it stings <br>
            But we both know what it means <br>
            And it's time to get real and inspired</p>

        <p>Now victory is all you need <br>
            So cultivate and plant the seed <br>
            Hold your breath and count to ten <br>
            Just count to ten, just count to ten</p>
        
        <p>I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell <br>
            I know it all too well br <br>
            Switchblade on the edge of your wrist <br>
            Can you witness (witness) <br>
            'Cause agony brings no reward <br>
            For one more hit and one last score <br>
            Don't be a casualty, cut the cord! </p>

        <p>Cut it! <br>
            Cut it!</p>
        
        <p>'Cause victory is all you need <br>
